# UniSimServer

A simulation game that takes place in 3d grid.

# Inspiration

- Rimworld (a lot)
- Hearthstone

# Core mechanics
A lot from Rimworld PLUS
- A resource-controlled implicit research system, instead of research.
- 3D space
- self-hostable server (required - the server may be packaged into the client at some point)


# TODO
- [A lot](docs/todo.org)
